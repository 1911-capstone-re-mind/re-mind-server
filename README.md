This project was built using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org), a framework that allows you to create desktop applications with web technologies. Other techologies include React.js, Redux.js, and HTML/CSS.

## Features

* Upon signup, users can enable any number of notificaitons they would like to receive.
* Users can edit the time intervals between notifications and duration for the breaks (if applicable).

## Project Information

This was a two and a half week capstone project for four students at [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com) in Chicago. The goal of this project was to challenge ourselves creating an ambitious application using the skills we have learned so far.

This project allowed us to utilize our skills in the web technologies we learned and apply them in a new way. Since operating systems can have many multiple processes unlike a web application, careful design of the application architexture was very important from the beginning. We had to make sure that the many different components of our application communicated together in a reliable way.

Communication between difference processes was one of the most difficult challenges fo this project. Since we created timers to keep track of reminders and allowed user input, we had to carefully come up with a fail-safe design for the application to prevent race conditions and unexpected behaviors.

Another challenge we faced was splitting up the client and server into different locations (desktop client and remote server). Since the two were not served from the same location, we had to think about how to configure the server endpoints and client requests to ensure reliable communication.
